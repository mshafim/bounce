# bounce

- Timeline:
  - Week 1: Dec 2 - Dec 8
    - Energy Component (object sliding down a hill)
    - Basic physics engine (gravity)
    - Create slide explaining conservation of energy
  - Week 2: Dec 9 - Dec 15
    - Projectile Component (going from the object leaving the hill to hitting the ground)
    - Create slide explaining projectile motion
  - Week 3: Dec 16 - Dec 22
    - Momentum Component (objectâ€™s first contact with the ground and colliding with the ground to initiate a bouncing phase)
    - Create slide explaining elastic collisions 
  - Week 4: Dec 23 - Dec 29
    - Implement game user interface (changing variables, start screen, target, high score, cosmetic flairs, etc)
  - Week 5: Dec 30 - Jan 5
    - Finishing Touches
    - Testing and debugging
    - Maybe adding additional physics concepts if time (friction, drag, additional collisions, etc)
